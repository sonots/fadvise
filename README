fadvise is a command used to give file advisory information to the operating system.
Its "don't need" option (fadvise --dontneed) is particularly useful to cause the files' pages (blocks) to be evicted from the buffer-cache.

Here is some sample output:
$ fadvise --verbose --dontneed foo.rrd
page size: 4096
foo.rrd: no incore pages.
And the usage information:
Usage:

     Options:
      -help - brief help message
      -man - full documentation
